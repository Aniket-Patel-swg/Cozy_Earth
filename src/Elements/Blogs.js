                        As a source of energy, green energy often comes from renewable energy technologies such as solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy, biomass and hydroelectric power. Each of these technologies works in different ways, whether that is by taking power from the sun, as with solar panels, or using wind turbines or the flow of water to generate energy.

                    <div id="Second-text">Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. It includes sources such as sunlight, wind, the movement of water, and geothermal heat.Renewable energy often provides energy for electricity generation to a grid, air and water heating/cooling, and stand-alone power systems. </div>
                    <div id="Second-text">An environmental footprint (also known as ecological footprint) takes into account the entirety of supply and demand of goods and services for the planet. In doing so, it is assumed that the entire population follows a certain lifestyle characterized by a known person or a group of people.</div>
